## House-Sales-Prediction in King Count USA
This is a Python data analysis project that takes a dataset with house sales and many other features to perform regression analysis. Given selected features, during the modeling process, the project predicts the house sale price based on these features. The Notebook has the following Sections:

- **Section 1**: Importing the dataset and making it available to work within the Notebook.
- **Section 2**: Data Wrangling.
- **Section 3**: EDA with Seaborn.
- **Section 4**: Model Development (Linear regression and Ridge regression) to predict house price.
- **Section 5**: Model Evaluation and Refinement using accuracy scores.

This is a brief summary of what is in the project for more and subsection, you may proceed to the notebook. Enjoy...

Thank you.
